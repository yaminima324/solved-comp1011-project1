<h1>Project Requirements</h1>

<ol>

 <li>Topics: Please choose one of the following three topics.

  <ol>

   <li>MTR travel Saver</li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>

This project develops a program to save the MTR travel cost for a family. To make it simple, we do not consider other traveling means. You may find an adult fare table from <a href="http://www.mtr.com.hk/en/customer/tickets/octopus_fares.html">http://www.mtr.com.hk/en/customer/tickets/octopus_fares.html</a><a href="http://www.mtr.com.hk/en/customer/tickets/octopus_fares.html">.</a> Assuming that there are n &gt; 1 family members. Each one of them will travel starting from home to another station. Generally, the destination stations are different. This program will compute the location (in terms of the station) where they should live to minimize the total travel cost. b. Introducing recursion

Write a program that will introduce the concept of recursion and give at least 3 examples (from beginner level to advanced level) to illustrate it.

<ol>

 <li>Course search in COMP</li>

</ol>

Write a program that will allow users to search undergraduate courses in COMP by using keywords. You should find all the undergraduate courses at <a href="https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/en-us/study/undergraduate-programmes/subject">https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/en</a><a href="https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/en-us/study/undergraduate-programmes/subject">–</a><a href="https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/en-us/study/undergraduate-programmes/subject">us/study/undergraduate</a><a href="https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/en-us/study/undergraduate-programmes/subject">–</a><a href="https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/en-us/study/undergraduate-programmes/subject">programmes/subject</a><a href="https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/en-us/study/undergraduate-programmes/subject">,</a> and store the information about courses. The users would input keywords and the program should return all of the related courses (e.g., the course name contains a keyword). For each returned course, its course name and pre-requisite information should be included (You might include more other information). You need to create a special structure for courses. You should use a suitable and efficient search algorithm.

<ol start="2">

 <li>Expected amount of work: around 20-30 hours 3. Deliverables:
